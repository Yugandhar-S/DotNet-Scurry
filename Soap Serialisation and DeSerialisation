/******************************************************************************
To support SOAP serialization, the .NET Framework provides the SoapFormatter class. 
 * This class is defined in the System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.
 * Soap namespace that is part of the System.Runtime.Serialization.Formatters.Soap.dll assembly. 
 * In order to use The SoapFormatter class, you must reference this assembly. 
 * Then, you can create an object and initialize it as you see fit. Before saving it, as always,
 * create a Stream-based object that would indicate the name (and location) of the file and the type of action to perform. 
 * Then, declare a SoapFormatter variable using its default constructor. To actually save the object, call the Serialize()
 * method of this class. This method uses the same syntax as that of the BinaryFormatter class: it takes two arguments.
 * The first is a Stream-based object. The second is the object that needs to be serialized.

 * 
 * 
 * De-serialization in soap is performed exactly as done for the binary de-serialization. 
 * To support it, the SoapFormatter class is equipped with the Deserialize() method. 
 * This method uses the same syntax as its equivalent of the BinaryFormatter class.
